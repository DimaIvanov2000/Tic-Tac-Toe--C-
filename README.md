# Tic Tac Toe in C

A tic tac toe game made in C, partially as a school project.

## How to Run

Download the file and / or run the code on your IDE of choice (Codeblocks or DevC++ should both work). A console menu should be display with several options.

## How to Use

Player inputs are made by entering (bottom, middle, or top) followed by (left, middle, or right), separated by a space. If an input is not valid, another input will be required. The program employs a perfect (to my knowledge) AI which goes for advantageous positions on the board and searches for win / loss conditions to occupy immediately. This AI can play against the user or engage in a match against itself to distract it from robotic world domination.
